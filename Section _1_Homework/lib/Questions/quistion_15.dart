/*
- For Dart to be a statically-typed language 
  means that the type of every variable is determined at compile time, rather than at runtime. 
  When you declare a variable, its type must be specified 
  and it cannot hold values of a different type later on except dynamic data type.
- The Dart compiler checks the types of variables at compile time.
  This means that any type mismatch will result in a compile-time error before the code is executed.
- Knowing the types of variables in advance allows the Dart compiler to optimize code more effectively,
  often resulting in faster execution.
